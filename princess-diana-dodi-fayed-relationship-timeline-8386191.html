According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a>, they met at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a polo match</a> when Dodi’s team played against Diana’s then-husband King Charles at Windsor Great Park. This interaction was later recreated on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>season 5 of The Crown</a>, though some details were changed: On The Crown, Dodi’s father, Mohamed, sponsors the polo match in 1990 (not 1986) in an attempt to sit next to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Queen Elizabeth</a>. However, he ends up seated next to Diana instead, who smiles at Dodi — though the two do not speak in the episode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The same year, both Diana and Dodi experienced strife in their individual relationships. Charles and Diana each began extramarital affairs in 1986: Charles confirmed in his authorized biography, The Prince of Wales, that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he began his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles</a>, while ex-army Major <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>James Hewitt</a> also claimed to have started a five-year affair with Princess Diana around the same time.
